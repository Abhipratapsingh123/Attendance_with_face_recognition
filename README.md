# Facial Recognition Based Attendance System

## Project Overview

This project implements an **automated attendance management system** using **facial recognition technology**. It captures student images, trains a machine learning model, recognizes faces in real-time, logs attendance in an Excel file, and sends email notifications to students automatically. The system is designed to replace manual attendance-taking methods and improve reliability and efficiency in educational and institutional environments.
